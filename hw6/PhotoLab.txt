In this program we load an image, use various functions to change the image, and then save/upload image.
The list of functions that change the image are:

    - Age the image
    - Change the color image to black and white
    - Make a negative of the image
    - Flip the image vertially
    - Mirror the image horizontally
    - Sharpen the image
    - Exchange the red and blue color channels
    - Add noise to the image
    - Add a border to the image

After these images are uploaded they are stored in http://students.chapman.edu/ ~jmau/index.html.
