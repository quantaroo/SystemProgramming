Blackjack Game
Jaccob Mau

This program will play the game of black jack like in the casinos.
You will first try to get as close to 21 without going over 21 in points.
You will ask the dealer to give you a random card from the deck until you are satified.
Then the dealer will try to beat your score. If your score beaten or equal to the dealer, you lose.
Otherwise you win.
