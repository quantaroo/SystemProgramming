HW 7 by Jaccob Mau

This program makes a image object and stores the necessary data inside the image object when producing the new image.
The new image is processed through the PhotoLab object with its DIP functions.
The new image is then uploaded.
When the DIP function is done, the PhotoLab object then clears the memory and deletes the image.

Known errors: occuring in the crop dip is not uploading to the server and there is one persistant instant creating multiple errors.
